About:
- Using Turing Learning and Genetic algorithm to generate datasets with similar stats but different graphs

Aim:
- To come up with an algorithm that takes in a 2-dimentional dataset and generates other
  datasets that have the same summary statistics as the original but looks graphically different.
  
- Extend the algorithm to carry out the same task on multi-dimentional datasets.
