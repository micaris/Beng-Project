# Final year project

Author: Osinowo Michael  
Institution: The University of Sheffield
Department: Automatic and Control Systems Engineering

About:

- Using Machine learning algorithms to generate datasets with similar stats but different graphs.
- Seeking to use Generative models to generate Synthetic data
- Why synthetic data ? : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_data#Applications

Aim:
- To come up with an algorithm that takes in a 2-dimentional dataset and generates other
  datasets that have the same summary statistics as the original but looks graphically different.
- Extend the algorithm to carry out the same task on multi-dimentional datasets using Generative Adverserial Networks.
